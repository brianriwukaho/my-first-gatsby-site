## Item 1: Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

### Advantages

One advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors they have names.

A second advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors they are not required to create a new object each time they're invoked.

A third advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they can return an object of any subtype of their return type.

A fourth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned type can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters.

A fifth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned object need not exist when the class containing the method is written.

### Limitations

The main limitation of providing only static factory methods is that classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed.

A second shortcoming of static factory methods is that they are hard for programmers to find.

## Item 2: Consider a builder when faced with many constructor parameters

### Examining object construction methods

Static factories and constructors do not scale well to large numbers of optional parameters.

The telescoping works, but it is hard to write client code when there are many constructors, and harder to read it.

A JavaBean may in an inconsistent state partway through its construction. 

The java been pattern also precludes the possibility of making a class immutable.

### Benefits of the builder pattern

The Builder pattern simulates named optional parameters.

The Builder pattern is well suited to class hierarchies.

The Builder pattern is a good choice when designing classes whose constructors or static factories who would more than a handful of parameters.

## Item 3: Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type

Making a class a singleton can make it difficult to test its clients.

A single-element enum type is often the best way to implement a single.

## Item 4: Enforce noninstantiability with a private constructor

Attempting to enforce noninstantiability by making a class abstract does not work.

A class can be made noninstantiable by including a private constructor.

## Item 5: Prefer dependency injection to hardwiring resources

Static utility classes and singletons are inappropriate for classes whose behaviour is parameterized by an underlying resource.

Pass the resource into the constructor when creating a new instance.

## Item 6: Avoid creating unnecessary objects

While String.matches is the easiest way to check if a string matches a regular expression, itâ€™s not suitable for repeated use in performance-critical situations.

Autoboxing blurs but does not erase the distinction between primitive and boxed primitive types.

Prefer primitives to boxed primitives, and watch for unintentional autoboxing.

Prefer primitives to boxed primitives, and watch out for unintentional autoboxing.

## Item 7: Eliminate obsolete object references

Nulling out object references should be the exception rather than the norm.

Whenever a class manages its own memory, the programmer should be alert for memory leaks.

Another common source of memory leaks is caches.

A common source of memory leaks is a listeners and other callbacks.

## Item 8: Eliminate finalizers and cleaners

Finalizers are unpredictable, often dangerous, and generally unnecessary.

Cleaners are less dangerous than finalizers, but still unpredictable, slow, and generaly unnecessary.

Never do anything time-critical in a finalizer or cleaner.

Never depend on a finalizer or cleaner to update persistent state.

There is a sever performance penalty for using finalizers and cleaners

Finalizers have a serious security problem: they open your class up to finalizer attacks.

Throwing an exception from a constructor should be sufficient to prevent an object from coming into existence; in the presence of finalizers it is not.

To protect an nonfinal classes from finalizer attacks, write a final finalize method that does nothing.

Have your class implement AutoClosable.

## Item 9: Prefer try-with-resources to try-finally
